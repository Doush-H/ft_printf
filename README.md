# ft_printf
This is one of the projects in the curriculum of 42 School.

## The goal of the school
The schools concept relies on you teaching yourself by learning how to do research and ask for help of your peers when needed. There are no teachers nor lectures. The curriculum includes planty of projects that you need to finish in order to progress and finish the school. The projects increase in difficulty as you go. Main programming language used in the school is `C` and on later stages of the curriculum `C++` besides these two you also learn about other stuff like: `Docker`, `Virtual Machines`, `networking` and more.

## The goal of the project
Recreating a simple version of the `printf()` function in C which is added to the [libft](https://github.com/Doush-H/libft) library. This version supports the following string conversions: `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%%`.

## In this project I learned about:
  - Variadic functions
  - Decimal to Hexadecimal conversion
  - Integer to string conversion

  
## How to use it?
Clone the git repository. Move into it and run `make`. The function prototpe is as follows `int t_printf(const char *format_str, ...)`.
